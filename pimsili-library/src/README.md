The Liquids HCA Tool is comprised of a Python module and Esri Python Toolbox 
containing tools that are used to determine which portions of the liquids pipeline 
could affect high consequence areas. These tools incorporate well understood and 
documented mathematical models for overland flow, gravity spread and hydrographic 
transport and provide a uantitative means for evaluating the fate of released products 
in common terrestrial settings.
	
This package is based on ArcGIS Pro 2.5 and python 3.6.
